## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Hardware Assembly**
   - Mount N20 motors with wheels for the drive base.  
   - Install lift mechanism with screw-drive N20 motor and brass nut.  
   - Connect motors to DRV8833 drivers (1 driver for base, 1 driver for lift).  
   - Wire drivers to XIAO ESP32-S3 through expansion board headers.  

2. **Software Setup**
   - Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) or [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).  
   - Add Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3 board package.  
   - Upload firmware from `src/` folder in this repo.  

3. **Control**
   - Default firmware uses Bluetooth (BLE) for RC control.  
   - Wi-Fi/WebSocket control option is also available (see `/examples`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
- Integrate ToF/Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance.  
- Encoder feedback for closed-loop drive control.  
- ROS2 integration for advanced autonomy.  
- Battery monitoring & charging circuit design.
